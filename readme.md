## Getting Started

### System Requirements

As this is a React JS application, you need the following to support your development environment.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Please go with any latest LTS versions)
* [Linux Based Terminal](https://gitforwindows.org/), if you're using Windows and installed with Git.
* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or a decent latest web browser.
* **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** is the go-to editor for some complex languages like React using JSX or TypeScript and I finally agreed with [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/) that VS Code is better for development of React JS. Obviously, with VS Code, you should be having the right extensions to support your React JS development, but comparing with Sublime Text 2, VS Code is still in its infancy:
  1. [Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) helps you to format your JavaScript / TypeScript / CSS using [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier).
  2. [Cobalt2 Theme Official](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wesbos.theme-cobalt2) is the theme used by Wes Bos, which comes with a nice user experience and a lot of awesome features.
  3. [GitLens - Git supercharged](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) supercharges the Git capabilities built into Visual Studio Code. It helps you to visualize code authorship at a glance via Git blame annotations and code lens, seamlessly navigate and explore Git repositories, gain valuable insights via powerful comparison commands, and so much more.
  4. [Git History](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.githistory) helps you to view git log, file history, compare branches or commits inside VS Code.
  5. [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) integrates ESLint into VS Code. If you are new to ESLint check the [documentation](http://eslint.org/).
  6. [ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets) provides you JavaScript and React/Redux snippets in ES7 with Babel plugin features for VS Code.
